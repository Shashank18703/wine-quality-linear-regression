# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

This project implements a **Linear Regression model from scratch using NumPy** to predict the quality of white wines based on physicochemical test results. It serves as a fundamental example of machine learning model implementation and evaluation without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn.
